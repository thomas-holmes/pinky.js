=========

Pinky.js is an implementation of the [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/) in JavaScript. It is fully compliant with the spec but is still pre-alpha quality code. Use it at your own risk.

Usage
=========

Pinky is an implementation of the Promises/A+ standard. It does so in way that emulates the .Net `Task` class.

    // The promise source is how you fulfill or reject a promise
    var promiseSource = new Pinky.PromiseSource();
    
    var promise = promiseSource.getPromise()
      // Do something asynchronously
    });
    
    promise.then(function(value) {
      // Do something interesting with your successful value
    },
    function(error) {
      // Do something with the error condition
    });

    promiseSource.fulfill(50);
